Number Swapper

Write a function to swap two numbers in place (that is, without temporary
variables).

a = a - b;
b = a + b;
a = b - a;

Word Frequencies

Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a
book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

int getFrequency(String[] book, String word) {
  word = word.trim().toLowerCase();
  int count = 0;
  for (String w : book) {
    if (w.trim().toLowerCase().equals(word)) {
      count++;
    }
  }
}
