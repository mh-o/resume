# 1631-Milestone-3

The only files you need to run the GUI are the updated 'CreateVotingApp.java', and 'gui.java'.

## GUI
** Behavoir is as follows: **

* Create New Vote XML will create a new XML document with the entered email, vote code, and filename
* Create New Test SCript will create a filename.script with the votes to be executed and submite them in that order
* Run Test SCript will execute the files in that order and display the results to the console
