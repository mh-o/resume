# Grading projects is a pain!
***Here are some tips you might find useful when grading this project:***
  (Aside from just giving me 100%)
  
  1. Default player names and ship locations will be used if you don't feel like entering your own. Simply press "ENTER" or click "OKAY" 4 times and the game will begin!
  2. If you want to test things that happen after a victory (like localstorage of scores), simply change if(hitCount1 == 12) and if(hitCount2 == 12) on lines 116 and 121 of myJS.js to if(hitCount1 == 1) and if(hitCount2 == 1) respectively. This means the game is over in one click!
  3. Alternatively, change those values to 2 to make sure my localstorage handling replaces the lowest of the 10 high scores with a new high score (spoiler alert: it does).
  4. REGEX implementation is at lines 280-282 of myJS.js
