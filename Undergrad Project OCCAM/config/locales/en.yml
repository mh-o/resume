  # Help messages (in markdown)
  help:
    error: |
      We have hit an unexpected issue on our end. We apologize for the inconvenience.
    notFound: |
      We are unable to find the page you requested. If you believe this is an error, please contact us.
    run: |
      You can run this object here by clicking on the Queue button below. Whenever there is an open slot available, the application will start and you will see a log of the progress. The application will present either a terminal or a video stream depending on what type of application it is.

    output: |
      This list shows all of the items this object created as output. You may also inspect the provenance of any output by clicking 'history'. Some output objects can be downloaded and others may be viewed.

    worksets: |
      **Experiments** are any run of a workload. You can devise a workflow and set up input
      parameters as part of an Experiment. To create one, first create a workset below.

      **Worksets** are a collection of Experiments that may be organized into Groups.
      When you have created a workset, navigate to that workset from this page. From there,
      you can add Experiments and Groups to this workset.

    directory: |
      To begin, you'll want to create an **Experiment**. An Experiment allows you to select and configure tools to run on a machine. Select "experiment" and type in a name to identify it and click "add" and it will take you to a page where you can start playing.

    reviewLinks: |
      A **review snapshot** will yield a link that you can share (regardless of whether or not the workset is marked private) which will
      allow a person to view a version of the workset without authorship information. This snapshot cannot be forked and will be
      established at the current revision without any ability to browse workset or experiment history.

    workflow: |
      A **workflow** describes how a collection of objects interact. Generally, it denotes a path from some input to some eventual result. For instance, you can describe a flow from a benchmark to a simulator. To do this, you would first attach a simulator. At that point, it will show you the possible input objects you can attach. You can select a benchmark on the left-hand side and all runs will use that benchmark with the given simulator.

    configuration: |
      Use ranged and listed options to create a set of experiments.

      Type `1, 2, 8` in a field to say you wish to run a separate experiment for each of the listed options.

      Type `1 ... 4` in a field to sweep an option and create an experiment for each valid value in that range.

      If you would like to created a range with a step, use the following syntax to add a mathematical function to update the next value based on the previous value. For instance, for a range that represents all even values use\:
      `0 ... 20 : x+2` and it will step every 2 values.

      You can express other complex values like so\:
      `1 ... 20: x*2` for powers of two\: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

      Notice that `x` in each example will be the previous value before generating the next until x is greater than the bounds of the range. In this case, `20`.

      You may combine these into a variety of ways. For example: `1 ... 9 : x+3, 21, 121` will create experiments for `1`, `4`, `7`, `21`, and `121`.

      All permutations of configurations will result in new experiment runs.

      moderation: |
        This section moderates account creation and establishes whether or not arbitrary
        people or systems can install objects on the system. If objects are moderated,
        for instance, somebody can import a simulator object, but only when an adminstrator
        authorizes it via this page will it actually be compiled, installed, and thus available
        to others.
      pendingAccounts: |
        This section lists accounts which were created but not yet active.
        These people cannot log into the system until you press the Activate button.
      pendingObjects: |
        This section lists pending objects requested by people on this system.
        Only when you press the activate button will an object actually be
        available to be built, placed on the filesystem, and thus able to
        be used.
      security: |
        This section lists options that affect the security related to this object on the
        system. When **Trust System-wide** is applied, the object may have extra privileges
        when executed on a person's own machine. System-wide trust is stronger than a
        single account's trust of an object. It applies to privileges on the server as well
        as client. The specific privileges are based on the object.

    citation: |
      This section provides generated citations that are appropriate for this artifact.
      Sometimes, the citation is a paper or other artifact hosted elsewhere, but the
      authors of this artifact requested that be cited instead of the software itself.

      Otherwise, the citation reflects this artifact and also has a tag for the
      revision (which represents this object at this specific point in time) which is
      enough to return to this, or a similar, page.

    pages: |
      Here, you can add or remove **pages** which are areas where you can add
      text, images, and embeddable widgets (such as plots or visualizations)
      which use data from past experiments.

      Just add a page and click on that page to continue. When you can edit
      the page, bubbles will appear to allow you to add new widgets or
      configure/edit the existing ones. Double-clicking on header or paragraph
      text will allow you to edit that text. Delete all of the text to remove
      the header, subheader, or paragraph from the page.

    workflowSelectionEmpty:
      Add a new node for input within the editor. When you do so, this panel will
      allow you to search for an object to use. It will give you the opportunity to
      use objects you have recently used and search using filters for exactly the
      object you want.
