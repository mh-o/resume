# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Spring Semester 2018

DUE 18 APR 2018 (Mon/Wed classes), 19 APR 2018 (Tue/Thu class)

## Deliverable 6

For this final deliverable, you and a partner will develop a project from scratch (see details) below, along with a detailed report on the testing strategy used.

Expect no mercy from my testing!  This is a relatively simple program but you will be expected to deal with all edge cases, find defects ahead of time, think of performance issues as explained in the requirements, etc.  I expect as close to bullet-proof an application as one could be expected to deliver, and that you have proved this by creating a good testing strategy based on all that we have learned this term.

You will develop an entire testing strategy for the application.  This testing strategy should cover all aspects of testing that we have covered.  It should show that you have thought deeply about the particular concerns of this piece of software.

I expect you to do independent research to determine general information about how to develop this application.  You may also wish to review the syllabus to see all of the kinds of testing that we have discussed this semester and when they are relevant.

Your paper should include the following three sections.  You should LABEL each section clearly.  You may use graphs, charts, etc. if these would help in understanding your position.

1. A review of the program's overall quality.  This should be done using the Red-Yellow-Green template (as explained in the lecture on "Interacting wih Stakeholders").  It is up to you to determine the subsets of functionality and/or subsystems.
2. Areas of concern.  We want the program to compare favorably in terms of features and quality with similar software.  If there are known defects, list them here.  These should be written using the standard defect template.  It is much better for your grade if you find a defect yourself and report it than if I find it.
3. Testing strategies used.  You should answer the following questions.
   1. What kinds of tests did you write? Why?
   2. What percentage of time/effort was allocated to each kind of test?
   3. What kinds of things did you discover in exploratory testing?
   4. If you developed a manual testing plan, include it here.

Your program MUST have at least 70% test coverage and have four or fewer errors from Rubocop (run on default settings).  Using reek may be helpful but it is not required for this deliverable.

You are not _required_ to create a traceability matrix for this assignment, but it would be a good addition to ensure that you have verified all of the requirements.

## Program Functionality

You are going to develop an interpreter for a simple language, RPN++.  This allows user to calculate using Reverse Polish Notation.  It also supports simple output via the PRINT keyword, variables, and the ability to quit.

Running the program without a filename will cause the program to enter a read-eval-print-loop (REPL).  In REPL mode, users can enter expressions one line at a time.  REPLs are widely used in many programming languages such as Ruby, Clojure, and Lisp.

When running the program with one or more arguments, each argument shall be considered a path to a filename.  The program shall execute each program stored in that filename.

Detailed requirements are listed below.

## Requirements

1. The program shall be named rpn.rb and should be runnable from the command line using the command `ruby rpn.rb`.
1. Tokens shall be numbers, variable names, operators, or one of the keywords QUIT, LET, or PRINT.
1. A number shall consist of one or more digits.  All numbers shall be arbitrary-precision (i.e., there shall be no integer overflow - 999999999999999999999999999 shall be considered a valid number and stored as such).
1. Variable names can be a single letter (A-Z) and are case-insensitive (e.g., `a` and `A` refer to the same variable).
1. Operators can be +, -, /, or *, for add, subtract, divide, and multiply, respectively.
1. The keyword QUIT causes the program to end.
1. Any lines or tokens after the QUIT keyword are ignored.
1. The keyword LET is followed by a single-letter variable, then an RPN expression.  The RPN expression is evaluated and the value of the variable is set to it. 
1. The keyword PRINT is followed by an expression, and the interpreter shall print the result of that expression to standard output (stdout).
1. Keywords shall be case-insensitive (e.g. `print`, `PRINT`, or `pRiNt` are interchangeable)
1. Keywords shall only start a line (e.g., you cannot have a line such as "1 2 + PRINT 3")
1. Variables shall be considered initialized once they have been LET.  It shall be impossible to declare a variable without initializing it to some value.
1. Referring to a variable which has not previously been LET (i.e. has not been declared) shall result in the program informing the user that the variable is uninitialized and QUIT the program with error code 1.  It should inform the user in the following format: "Line n: Variable x is not initialized." where `x` is the name of the variable and `n` is the line number of the file the error occurred in.
1. The exception to the previous requirement is that if this occurs in REPL mode, the user shall be informed, but the line will simply be ignored.
1. If the stack for a given line is empty OR does not contain the correct number of elements on the stack for that operator, and an operator is applied, the program shall inform the user and QUIT the program with error code 2.  It should inform the user in the following format: "Line n: Operator o applied to empty stack" where `o` is the operator used and `n` is the line number the error occurred in.
1. The exception to the previous requirement is that if this occurs in REPL mode, the user shall be informed, but the line will simply be ignored.
1. If the stack for a given line contains more than one element and the line has been evaluated, the program shall inform the user and QUIT the program with error code 3.  It should inform the user in the following format: "Line n: y elements in stack after evaluation" where `y` is the number of elements in the stack and `n` is the line number the error occurred in.
1. The exception to the previous requirement is that if this occurs in REPL mode, the user shall be informed, but the line will simply be ignored.
1. If an expression used for initializing a LET variable is invalid, the variable is considered to have not been initialized.  For example, "LET A 1 2" is invalid, and A is not initialized.
1. If an invalid keyword is used, the program shall inform the user and QUIT the program with error code 4.  It should inform the user in the following format: "Line n: Unknown keyword k" where `k` is the keyword and `n` is the line number the error occurred in.
1. The exception to the previous requirement is that if this occurs in REPL mode, the user shall be informed, but the line will simply be ignored.
1. All other errors shall result in the program informing the user of the error and exiting with error code 5.  At no point shall the end user of the system see a "raw" exception or stack trace.
1. In REPL mode, the result of each line shall be displayed immediately afterwards before another prompt comes up.
1. In REPL mode, PRINT shall not perform any additional work, as the result of the RPN expression evaluation will already be displayed.
1. In REPL mode, when displaying error messages, the current line shall be considered as the nth command entered. For example, the first line entered shall be considered Line 1, the second line entered Line 2, etc.
1. This program shall minimize real execution time, even at the expense of memory or CPU usage.
1. The "> " string shall be used as the prompt for REPL mode.  Note that there is a space after the > character.
1. In case of ambiguity in requirements, the sample output shall be considered the ground truth.
1. When reading multiple files, all of the files shall be concatenated into one large file before processing.  For example, when executing file1.rpn and file2.rpn, and file1.rpn initializes a variable A, file2.rpn can use variable A without initializing it.  Similarly, if a QUIT is encountered at the end of file1.rpn, the entire program will quit and no lines in file2.rpn shall be executed.
1. Blank lines in files shall be ignored.
1. Lines in files are considered to be 1-indexed, that is, the first line in a file is line number 1, not 0.
1. Variable values shall not be persisted across executions.  In other words, if I initialize a variable `a`, then quit the program and start it again, variable `a` is no longer initialized.

## Sample Output

Note that `cat` is the command to display a file and `$` is simply the default bash prompt.  Thus,

```
$ cat Foo.rpn
LET A 1
```

is a way to show you that the contents of the file `Foo.rpn` consist of one line, `LET A 1`.

It may be useful to copy and paste some of these files to your own computer for testing purposes.

Note that your program will be tested with different files than the ones here.

## Format
Every assignment should have a title page with:
* The names of the students in the group and their GitHub usernames
* The title "CS 1632 - DELIVERABLE 6: Testing Strategy for RPN++"
* Link to the GitHub URL

_Remember that the GitHub repository should be private, but the TA and I should be added as collaborators_.

## Automated Test Suite

I expect a unit test suite of _at least_ 20 unit tests, evaluating a variety of different base, edge, and possibly corner cases.  As always, this should be well-commented and of high quality.

Your test suite should also (as mentioned above) have >70% statement coverage (as measured by simplecov) of the pogram.

You do NOT need to run rubocop or simplecov on the test code itself.

## Grading
```
Overall review of quality: 10%
Description of issues and enhancements: 10%
Description of testing strategy: 10%
Program Functionality: 40%
Automated Test Suite (incl. test coverage >= 70%): 30%
