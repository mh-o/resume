# RESUME
This repo will serve as a collection of undergraduate and personal work during my time in software development. It will also serve of an index of projects that best exemplify different areas of development.

## Personal Projects
- I am currently working on a fitness/workout tracking application written in Java via AndroidStudio.
- This app will store a workout/lift in a database via JDBC and compare performance percentiles to other users.

## Web Development
[OCCAM](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20Project%20OCCAM)
- Developed UI mainly using Ruby, HAML, SCSS, and JSON but also needed knowledge of the full stack which included a Python backend, Puma daemon, Sinatra server (similar to Ruby on Rails).
- All ran on a Linux VM using VirtualBox.

## Java

## Linux/C
[Binary/Counting Semaphores](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1550%20Operating%20Systems/project_2)
- More recent work so it is a better example of my current coding style/conventions.
- All projects in 1550 will use Linux/C but we were given the least amount of direction for this project so the code for aptsim.c was written from scratch.
