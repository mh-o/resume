# RESUME
All of these projects are contained in the folders above - I just wanted to make it easier to sift through. Some, but not all of my work has been sorted by the languages/tools/frameworks highlighted below.
***
## Java
![java][java_logo]
#### Software Engineering (Pitt):
[Texas Holdem in Java/Swing](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering/src/main/java/TexasHoldem.java)
- The file linked above gives a good overview of the main program and some of the coding style used, but the entire project directory including tests and build scripts can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering) while all of the core java files can be found [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering/src/main/java).
- This was intended to be an agile group project that spanned the entire semester - however I ended up writing 99% of the code myself.
#### Software Design Methodology (Pitt):
[Java based Voting Application](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1631%20Software%20Design%20Methodology/Components/TempBloodPressure/CreateTempBloodPressure.java)
- The file linked above is a good example of one that I wrote a majority of - this was a large project and so many of the files were shelled out for us or provided. However, for the full project and build scripts, click [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1631%20Software%20Design%20Methodology).
- This is probably my best example of manipulating a real-world existing Java application.
#### Database Management Systems (Pitt):
[Messenger Application in Java/JDBC/SQL](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1555%20Database%20Management%20Systems/Term%20Project/Messenger.java)
- File linked above is the main Java file, but the entire repo is [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1555%20Database%20Management%20Systems/Term%20Project).
- Overlaps with SQL, worked with a partner for this project.
#### Google's Coding Competition
In my spare time I attempt coding challenges from past Google competitions, to practice my knowledge of algorithms and keep myself well-versed in Java. For a quick example of some code, click [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Google's%20Kick%20Start%202013/Round%20A/Problem%20B/RationalNumberTree.java), or see any of the 'Google's Kick Start' folders above.

## SQL (Naturally, this section overlaps with others)
![sql][sql_logo]
#### Programming Languages for Web Applications (Pitt):
[Chat Room](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1520%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Web%20Applications/Chatroom/chat.py) | 
[Event Planner](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1520%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Web%20Applications/Event%20Planner/catering.py)
- These are just the main python files for each respective application which contains the connection to the SQL database via SQLite, along with other SQL applications.
#### Database Management Systems (Pitt):
[Messenger Application in Java/JDBC/SQL](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1555%20Database%20Management%20Systems/Term%20Project/transactions_messenger.sql)
- Linked above is one of the main SQL files, but others are available in the repo [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1555%20Database%20Management%20Systems/Term%20Project).
- Overlaps with Java, worked with a partner on this project.

## Web Development
![rails][rails_logo]
#### Full Stack/UI (Capstone)
[OCCAM](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20Project%20OCCAM)
- Developed UI mainly using Ruby, HAML, SCSS, and JSON but also needed knowledge of the full stack which included a Python backend, Puma daemon, Sinatra server (similar to Ruby on Rails).
- All ran on a Linux VM using VirtualBox.
***
## Ruby
![ruby][ruby_logo]
#### Software Quality Assurance (Pitt):
[Multithreaded Hash Checker in JRuby](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1632%20Software%20Quality%20Assurance/Deliverable%203/hash_checker.rb)
- All the projects for this class were in Ruby - which I thoroughly enjoyed. The rest of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1632%20Software%20Quality%20Assurance).
- This was a project in which I essentially went above and beyond to implement multi-threading in JRuby, so I have some knowledge of threading in Java as a result. This was before I took operating systems so my understanding has improved since this project.
***
## Linux/C
![linux][linux_logo]
#### Operating Systems (Pitt):
[Binary/Counting Semaphores](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1550%20Operating%20Systems/project_2)
- More recent work so it is a better example of my current coding style/conventions.
- All projects in 1550 will use Linux/C but we were given the least amount of direction for this project so the code for aptsim.c was written from scratch.
