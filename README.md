# RESUME
This repo will serve as a collection of undergraduate and personal work during my time in software development. It will also serve of an index of projects that best exemplify different areas of development.

## Java
#### Software Engineering (Pitt):
[Texas Holdem in Java/Swing](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering/src/main/java/TexasHoldem.java)
- The file linked above gives a good overview of the main program and some of the coding style used, but the entire project directory including tests and build scripts can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering) while all of the core java files can be found [here](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1530%20Software%20Engineering/src/main/java).
- This was intended to be an agile group project that spanned the entire semester - however I ended up writing 99% of the code myself.

## SQL
Naturally, this section will overlap with others as I've used SQL in databases for certain projects.
#### Programming Languages for Web Applications (Pitt):
[Chat Room](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1520%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Web%20Applications/Chatroom/chat.py)
[Event Planner](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/blob/master/Undergrad%20CS1520%20Programming%20Languages%20for%20Web%20Applications/Event%20Planner/catering.py)
- These are just the main python files for each respective application which contains the connection to the SQL database via SQLite, along with other SQL applications.

## Web Development
[OCCAM](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20Project%20OCCAM)
- Developed UI mainly using Ruby, HAML, SCSS, and JSON but also needed knowledge of the full stack which included a Python backend, Puma daemon, Sinatra server (similar to Ruby on Rails).
- All ran on a Linux VM using VirtualBox.

## Linux/C
[Binary/Counting Semaphores](https://github.com/mh-o/resume/tree/master/Undergrad%20CS1550%20Operating%20Systems/project_2)
- More recent work so it is a better example of my current coding style/conventions.
- All projects in 1550 will use Linux/C but we were given the least amount of direction for this project so the code for aptsim.c was written from scratch.
